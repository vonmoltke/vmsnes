This is my personal fork of the Higan (formerly known as bsnes) emulator.  See http://byuu.org/ for the original.

The original emulator covered the Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom), GameBoy, and GameBoy Advance.  I'm only interested in the first two, so I have removed the lstter two from the emulator core.  I don't intend to put them back at this time, unless people actually use this emulator and ask for it.

My primary motivation for this is to work on the emulator core.  I don't think I am going to do much with the UI, except try to make it cross-platform again (the beta version I forked from is Linux-only).
